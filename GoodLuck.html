    <p>1. Place Rosemary (fresh or dried) in your left hand. 🌿</p>
    <p>2. Add a bit of your perfume. 😻</p>
    <p>3. Add some salt and a few drops of lemon. 🍋</p>
    <p>4. Rub your hands together while saying: 👏🏾</p>
    <p><i>"By the power of this Rosemary, I remove all obstacles in my path.<br><br>By the power of this lemon, I cut all negativity in my life.<br><br>And by the power of this salt, all my luck shall return to me. Àṣẹ."</i></p>
    <p>After the 3rd time say: "<i>So I speak and so shall it be. And so it is, so it is, so it is.</i></p>
    <p>5. Rinse your hands thoroughly with water and let them air dry. 💨💨</p>
