      <h2>1) Cord Removal (1x)</h2>
      <p>
        All hooks, cords, and attachments ‚Äî whether emotional, physical, mental, spiritual, astral, causal, or soul ‚Äî are inappropriate and disallowed. I remove these from every level: every chakra, every organ, and every cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also remove any roots, seeds, or branches left behind by these hooks, cords, or attachments in the highest and best way, sending them to God‚Äôs light now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cleanse, clear, and release any and all attachments to my mind, body, heart, soul, spirit, life, essence, and shadow. I release, dissolve, and return all attachments, whether from entities, people, places, situations, or things ‚Äî seen and unseen, known and unknown ‚Äî with clarity and compassion, freeing myself, & all involved in the highest and best way.
      </p>
      <p>
        As these ties are severed, I fill the space with unconditional love and radiant light, restoring wholeness, harmony, and protection to every part of my being. I am cleansed, shielded, and empowered, aligned with the infinite source of divine truth, love, and peace.  
        <br>So I speak and so shall it be.

      <h2>2) Call Back My Power (3x)</h2>
      <p>
        I call back all of my energy and power, cleansed, cleared, transmuted and charged to its highest form. I reclaim it across all times, spaces, dimensions, versions of reality, parallels, worlds, realms, universes, lifetimes, situations, and timelines.
        <br>So I speak and so shall it be.

      <h2>3) Mirrored Bubble Shield (3x)</h2>
      <p>
        I ask and it is my intent that a mirrored bubble shield of unconditional white light and love is placed around me, surrounding me for my highest good, my highest peace and my highest protection.
        Anything directed at me is returned to sender through the filter of divine truth.<br><br>Here now, forevermore and always, so be it and it is done. </p>

      <h2>4) 7-Knot Thread Mantra</h2>
      <p>Spirit, let this 7 knot thread on my arm, shield me, ground me and guard me from all harm.</p>
