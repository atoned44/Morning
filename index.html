        <b>As You Awaken Energy Release Mantra - 1x
        <a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/05fCa7Hu83MDzzReUEpxlzsag#WakeUp"> (Audio for Affirmation)</a></b><br>
      As day break marks the end of my restful sleep,<br>
      I release all energy not mine to keep.<br>
      Fill that void with peace, love and white light,<br>
      Spirit, please guide me today true and right.<br>
      Shield me from darkness that may come my way,<br>
      So that in serenity I will remain all day. √Ä·π£·∫π.</p>
      
      <p><b>Mantra 1 - Cord Removal</b><br>
      All hooks, cords, and attachments‚Äîwhether emotional, physical, 
      mental, spiritual, astral, causal, or soul‚Äîare inappropriate and 
      disallowed. I remove these from every level: every chakra, every 
      organ, and every cell.<br>I also remove any roots, seeds, or 
      branches left behind by these hooks, cords, or attachments in the 
      highest and best way, sending them to God‚Äôs light now.<br>
      I cleanse, clear, and rebuke any and all attachments to my mind, body, heart, soul, 
      spirit, life, essence, and shadow. I command these attachments, whether from entities, 
      people, places, situations, or things‚Äîseen and unseen, known and unknown‚Äîto be released
      and turned to God's divine light for purification and elevation to their highest good.<br>
      As these ties are severed, I fill the space with unconditional love and radiant light, 
      restoring wholeness, harmony, and protection to every part of my being. 
      I am cleansed, shielded, and empowered, aligned with the infinite source of divine truth, love, and peace.<br>
      So I speak and so shall it be. √Ä·π£·∫π. üôè<br><br>

       <p class="large-text"><b>&#10687; <a href="return.html">Return to Sender</a></b></p>
      
      <b>Mantra 2 - Call Back My Power (3x)</b><br>
      I call back all of my energy and power, cleansed, cleared, 
      transmuted and charged to its highest form. I reclaim it across all times, 
      spaces, dimensions, versions of reality, parallels, worlds, realms, 
      universes, lifetimes, situations, and timelines. <br>

      So I speak and so shall it be. √Ä·π£·∫π. üôè
      <p class="large-text"><b>&#10687; <a href="recall.html">Recalling my energy - full</a></b></p>

      <b>Mantra 3 - Transmute Lower Vibrational Energy for My Highest Good</b><br>
      All lower vibrational energies and intentions directed towards me ‚Äî whether seen or unseen, known or unknown ‚Äî are hereby acknowledged and embraced with gratitude.<br>
      I transmute these energies now into pure love, strength, and wisdom, allowing them to serve my highest good in every aspect of my being: mind, body & soul.<br>
      These energies are no longer burdens to carry but blessings transformed. With divine grace and gratitude, I release and integrate this new energy across every layer of my existence, aligning with the highest light and truth.<br>
      So I speak, and so it is. √Ä·π£·∫π. üôè
