      <b><a href="https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/05fCa7Hu83MDzzReUEpxlzsag#WakeUp">Audio for Affirmation</a></b><br>
      As day break marks the end of my restful sleep,<br>
      I release all energy not mine to keep.<br>
      Fill that void with peace, love and white light,<br>
      Spirit, please guide me today true and right.<br>
      Shield me from darkness that may come my way,<br>
      So that in serenity I will remain all day. √Ä·π£·∫π.</p>
      
      <p><b>Mantra 1 - Cord Removal</b><br>
      All hooks, cords, and attachments‚Äîwhether emotional, physical, 
      mental, spiritual, astral, causal, or soul‚Äîare inappropriate and 
      disallowed. I remove these from every level: every chakra, every 
      organ, and every cell. Additionally, I remove any roots, seeds, or 
      branches left behind by these hooks, cords, or attachments in the 
      highest and best way, sending them to God‚Äôs light now.<br>
      So I speak and so shall it be. √Ä·π£·∫π. üôè<br><br>
      
      <b>Mantra 2 - Call Back My Power (3x)</b><br>
      I call back all of my energy and power, cleansed, cleared, and 
      transmuted to its highest form. I reclaim it across all times, 
      spaces, dimensions, versions of reality, parallels, worlds, realms, 
      universes, lifetimes, situations, and timelines. <br>
      So I speak and so shall it be. √Ä·π£·∫π. üôè<br><br>

        <i>Stretch it. Twist it. Make it grow.<br>
        Like a river. Let it flow.<br>
        Three times fast, shall this hair grow.<br>
        This is my will. So shall it be.<br>
        And so it is, so it is, so it is. √Ä·π£·∫π.</i><br><br>
