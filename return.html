    <h1 class="large-text">Declaration of Sovereignty and Divine Protection</h1>
    <p class="large-text">
        I stand in my full spiritual authority.\n
        I revoke and dissolve any and all contracts—spoken or unspoken, written or unwritten, ancestral or energetic—that were made using my name, energy, essence, likeness or consent, knowingly or unknowingly.\n
        I transmute every binding, every offering, and every deception through divine justice. I return them to their sender, stripped of power, multiplied by truth.\n
        I am surrounded by a shield of pure, white, heavenly, divine light. No deception can penetrate.\n
        I call on the shield of Archangel Michael—his blue flame, his sword of justice, his divine protection. With him by my side, no shadow can cross this threshold.\n
        Any attempt to access me, bind me, confuse me, or pull from me shall fail. My field is sealed. My essence is mine. My soul belongs to no one but the divine.\n
        It is done. It is sealed. It is returned.\n
        So it is. Àṣẹ. 🙏
