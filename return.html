    <p class="large-text">
        <i>In the presence of the Most High, Divine Mother, my ancestors and guides, and Archangel Michael.</i><br><br>
        I stand in my full spiritual authority.<br><br>
        I revoke and dissolve any and all contracts ‚Äî spoken or unspoken, written or unwritten, ancestral or energetic ‚Äî that were made using my name, energy, essence, likeness or consent, knowingly or unknowingly.<br><br>
        I transmute every binding, every offering, and every deception through divine justice.<br><br>
        I return it to its sender ‚Äî stripped of power, multiplied by truth.<br><br>
        I am surrounded by a shield of divine white light. No deception can enter. No shadow can linger.<br><br>
        I call on Archangel Michael ‚Äî his sword of justice, his blue flame, his unwavering protection. With him at my threshold, no interference shall pass.<br><br>
        I reject all confusion, all bindings, all silent monitoring, all energetic extraction.<br><br>
        My field is sealed. My essence is mine. My essence is sovereign. My soul belongs only to the Divine.<br><br>
        It is done. It is sealed. It is returned. So it is. √Ä·π£·∫π. üôè
