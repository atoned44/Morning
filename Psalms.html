    <p><b>PSALM 91</b> <br>
      Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
      I say of the Most High, “You are my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”<br>
      Surely the Most High will save me from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
      The Most High will cover me with their feathers, and under their wings I will find refuge; their faithfulness is my shield and rampart.<br>
      I will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.<br>
      A thousand may fall at my side, ten thousand at my right hand, but it will not come near me. I will only observe with my eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.<br>
      I say, “The Most High is my refuge," and I make the Most High my dwelling, so no harm will overtake me, no disaster will come near my tent.<br>
      For the Most High will command their angels concerning me to guard me in all my ways; they will lift me up in their hands, so that I will not strike my foot against a stone.<br>
      I will tread on the lion and the cobra; I will trample the great lion and the serpent.<br>
      "Because she loves me," says the Most High, "I will rescue her; I will protect her, for she acknowledges my name. She will call on me, and I will answer her;<br>
      I will be with her in trouble, I will deliver her and honor her. With long life I will satisfy her and show her my salvation."<br>
      <i>So shall it be, and so it is, so it is, so it is. Àṣẹ.</i> 🙏<br><br>
    <p><b>PSALM 150</b><br>
      1. Praise the Most High. <br>
      Praise the Most High in their sanctuary; <br>
      praise them in their mighty heavens. <br>
      2. Praise them for their acts of power; <br>
      praise them for their surpassing greatness. <br>
      3. Praise them with the sounding of the trumpet, <br>
      praise them with the harp and lyre, <br>
      4. Praise them with timbrel and dancing, <br>
      praise them with the strings and pipe, <br>
      5. Praise them with the clash of cymbals, <br>
      praise them with resounding cymbals. <br>
      6. Let everything that has breath praise the Most High. <br>
      Praise the Most High. Àṣẹ.<br><br>
